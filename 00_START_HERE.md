## 🔧 What Was Built

**SafePath Guardian** is a complete real-time child route monitoring system that:

1. **Lets parents create routes** - Define custom checkpoints on a map
2. **Monitors in real-time** - Shows live distance to next checkpoint
3. **Notifies on arrival** - Sends alerts when child reaches each point
4. **Celebrates completion** - Shows congratulations when journey ends
5. **Optimizes battery** - Uses smart GPS filtering (5% vs 100% battery)
6. **Works everywhere** - Android and iOS with proper permissions
7. **Handles errors** - Graceful failures with user feedback
8. **Respects resources** - Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks
